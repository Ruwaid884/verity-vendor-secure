- Form validation and error handling

## Technical Stack
- **Runtime**: Node.js (needs to be installed)
- **Package Manager**: Bun or npm (needs setup)
- **Development**: Hot reload with Vite
- **Linting**: ESLint with TypeScript rules
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout

## Current Status
- Project scaffolding is complete
- Dependencies are defined but not installed
- Node.js ecosystem needs to be set up on the system
- Core application structure is in place with routing, auth context, and basic pages

## Immediate Setup Needs
1. Install Node.js (recommended: use nvm for version management)
2. Install dependencies (npm install or bun install)
3. Set up Supabase configuration
4. Start development server
5. Configure environment variables for Supabase connection
